# Reference 1
Real-world application of tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-high) and microsatellite instability (MSI) confirms their utility as immunotherapy biomarkers
1. Attitude to TMB for perdiction of ICIs response: positive
2. TMB threshold used: 20 mut/Mb
3. Panel: a 324-gene panel
4. Seqence: next generation sequencing (NGS) (FoundationOne CDx, a CLIA-approved laboratory)
5. ICI drug: pembrolizumab
The main result:
Among MSI-H and TMB-H patients, median PFS for patients who received chemotherapy alone versus immunotherapy alone was 6.75 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.9-10.9 months] and 24.2 months (95% CI, 9.6 months to not reached), respectively, with a P value of 0.042
