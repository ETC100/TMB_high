# Reference 1
Real-world application of tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-high) and microsatellite instability (MSI) confirms their utility as immunotherapy biomarkers
1. Attitude to TMB for perdiction of ICIs response: positive
2. TMB threshold used: 20 mut/Mb
3. Panel: a 324-gene panel
4. Seqence: next generation sequencing (NGS) (FoundationOne CDx, a CLIA-approved laboratory)
5. ICI drug: pembrolizumab
The main result:
Among MSI-H and TMB-H patients, median PFS for patients who received chemotherapy alone versus immunotherapy alone was 6.75 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.9-10.9 months] and 24.2 months (95% CI, 9.6 months to not reached), respectively, with a P value of 0.042

# Reference 2
Analysis of 100,000 human cancer genomes reveals the landscape of tumor mutational burden
1. Attitude to TMB for perdiction of ICIs response: positive
2.Why consider synonymous mutations: While synonymous mutations are not likely to be directly involved in creating immunogenicity, their presence is a signal of mutational processes that will also have resulted in nonsynonymous mutations and neoantigens elsewhere in the genome
3.The relationship between TMB and MSI: MSI-high -> TMB-high, however, TMB-high does not often mean MSI-high.
The vast majority of MSI-High samples also had high TMB (83%), and 97% had TMB ≥10 mutations/Mb. However, the converse was not true; only 16% of samples with high TMB were classified as MSI-High

# Reference 3
Initial results from a phase II study of nivolumab (NIVO) plus ipilimumab (IPI) for the treatment of metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer
Drug: nivolumab
This study use median as threshold for TMB-high identification, which was up to 74.5
Result: Higher TMB was predictive of better RR and longer PFS
Given that there is currently no established threshold for nivolumab, I think researchers may find it imperative to utilize soft thresholding as a flexible approach in their investigations

# Reference 4
We can see other studies using nivolumab for ICI therapy.
Genomic biomarkers of response to nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi) and nivolumab (nivo) monotherapy in 108 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma
Drug: nivolumab
Soft threshold: 64 mut/Mb, according to median

# Reference 5
Genomic biomarkers of response to nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi) and nivolumab (nivo) monotherapy in 108 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma
Drug: nivolumab
Soft threshold: high ≥167, medium 85–166, low <85
TMB was defined as the total number of missense somatic mutations per tumor, and was evaluated as a continuous variable and by tertiles
Higher TMB correlated with better RR and longer PFS

# Reference 6
Genomic biomarkers of response to nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi) and nivolumab (nivo) monotherapy in 108 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma
Drug: nivolumab or nivo+ipi
Strantegy: WES, no panel
Soft threshold: TMB high (≥248 mut) vs medium (143-247 mut) vs low (<143 mut)
High TMB predicted better efficacy for the combination compared.to nivolumab

# Reference 7
Pembrolizumab in Patients With Tumors With High Tumor Mutational Burden: Results From the Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study
Drug: Pembrolizumab
Hard threshold: ≥9 mutations per megabase
Strantegy: Unknown
Pembrolizumab demonstrated antitumor activity in pretreated patients with advanced cancers and HTMB
This ariticle is not open access

# Reference 8
Pembrolizumab in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer With High Tumor Mutational Burden: Results From the Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) Study
Sample size: 28
Drug: Pembrolizumab
threshold: HTMB as ≥ 9 Mut/Mb measured by the Foundation Medicine’s (Cambridge, MA) FoundationOne assay
Strantegy: Unknown
1. There was variation in the TMB among the breast cancer subsets with the highest median TMB observed in triple-negative tumors and the lowest in HER2-negative and ER-positive or progesterone receptor–positive tumors. In this series, anecdotal responses to CPIs were noted in high tumor mutational burden (HTMB) tumors
2. This study support the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of pembrolizumab for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with HTMB without alternative treatment options

# Reference 9
Establishing guidelines to harmonize tumor mutational burden (TMB): in silico assessment of variation in TMB quantification across diagnostic platforms: phase I of the Friends of Cancer Research TMB Harmonization Project
Result: Lastly, the eight cancers in stratum 1 were analyzed separately. UCEC, BLCA and COAD had the broadest range of slope values (UCEC: range 0.755–1.602, ∆ 0.847; BLCA: range 1.042–1.79, ∆ 0.748; COAD: range 0.75–1.486, ∆ 0.736) (figure 2, online supplementary table 4), and most laboratories consistently overestimated these cancer types, with BLCA as the only cancer type for which all 11 laboratories (100%) consistently overestimated their panel TMB values relative to WES TMB. Conversely, LUAD, LUSC and HNSC had the tightest range of slope values with no consistent bias to overestimating or underestimating TMB (LUAD: range 0.817–1.135, ∆ 0.318; LUSC: range 0.741–1.099, ∆ 0.358; HNSC: range 0.854–1.244, ∆ 0.39).
