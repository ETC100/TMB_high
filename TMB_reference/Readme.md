# Reference 1
Real-world application of tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-high) and microsatellite instability (MSI) confirms their utility as immunotherapy biomarkers
1. Attitude to TMB for perdiction of ICIs response: positive
2. TMB threshold used: 20 mut/Mb
3. Panel: a 324-gene panel
4. Seqence: next generation sequencing (NGS) (FoundationOne CDx, a CLIA-approved laboratory)
5. ICI drug: pembrolizumab
The main result:
Among MSI-H and TMB-H patients, median PFS for patients who received chemotherapy alone versus immunotherapy alone was 6.75 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.9-10.9 months] and 24.2 months (95% CI, 9.6 months to not reached), respectively, with a P value of 0.042

# Reference 2
Analysis of 100,000 human cancer genomes reveals the landscape of tumor mutational burden
1.Why consider synonymous mutations: While synonymous mutations are not likely to be directly involved in creating immunogenicity, their presence is a signal of mutational processes that will also have resulted in nonsynonymous mutations and neoantigens elsewhere in the genome
2.The relationship between TMB and MSI: MSI-high -> TMB-high, however, TMB-high does not mean MSI-high.
The vast majority of MSI-High samples also had high TMB (83%), and 97% had TMB â‰¥10 mutations/Mb. However, the converse was not true; only 16% of samples with high TMB were classified as MSI-High
