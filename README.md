How to identify TMB high patients

# What is TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden)?
"TMB high" typically refers to a high Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) in the context of cancer research and immunotherapy. TMB is a measure of the number of mutations present in a tumor's DNA. A high TMB indicates that there are a large number of mutations in the tumor.

In cancer research, TMB high is often associated with better responses to certain types of immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Tumors with high TMB may have a higher likelihood of being recognized by the immune system as foreign, leading to a stronger immune response against the tumor.

Researchers and clinicians may use TMB as a biomarker to predict response to immunotherapy and to guide treatment decisions for cancer patients. High TMB is one of the factors considered when assessing a patient's suitability for immunotherapy treatment.

It's important to note that the interpretation of TMB results and its clinical significance may vary depending on the specific cancer type, treatment approach, and individual patient characteristics.
